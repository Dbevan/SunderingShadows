//Updated by ~Circe~ 5/12/08 after conversations with Ares
// Rebalanced (and holy word) as it does more damage and effects to every opponent, than higher level spells even do to single foes.
// Now single target, retains damage boost on aligns and various effects; removed half-dmg on save so it wasn't too nerfed.
// Lowered blindness duration, buffed stun duration. N, 5/11.
