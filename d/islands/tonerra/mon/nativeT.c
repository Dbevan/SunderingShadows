    This smallish man stands before. An occasional screach of anger 
eminate from his misshapen mouth. Distrust and fear cross his face.
This is quite obviously his home and his place to live. He will defend
it from intruders with his life. He wields a spear or a small sword.
Once in a while you find one wielding a dagger or a bow. The hides he
wears seems to offer little protection but he does manage to avoid and 
move quickly.
