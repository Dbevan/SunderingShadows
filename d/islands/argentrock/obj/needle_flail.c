The Needles of the Forest, as the clerics called themselves, wandered the Darkwood Forest to explore the hidden beauty.  While within the forest, the Needles came often under attack from the forces of the Lords of Fury, more deities whose names have been lost to the times.  Fighting to protect their beloved forest, the Needles found a way to use nature against their foes, thus the Flail of Needles was born.  Though the clerics named their own order, they clearly assumed that none would ever forget the deities' names, for those have gone unrecorded.");
