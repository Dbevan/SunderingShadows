%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Hobgoblins are about 6 1/2 feet tall with hairy hides that range in color from a dark reddish-brown to dark grey. They have either yellowish or dark brown eyes, and their faces show either dark red or red-orange skin. The males have red or blue noses, and all have sharp yellow teeth. They prefer brightly colored clothing, especially colors that remind them of blood. Their leather is usually tinted black and they keep their weapons polished and in good shape. They are almost constantly at war with the other humanoid races, and particularly hate elves. They are a military society, proud of their fighting skills. Some of them have villages, but most live underground or in caverns. They feel that they are superior to goblins and orcs, and often use them as battle fodder. The mercenaries have no qualms working for powerful or rich evil humanoids.

%^RED%^Warning:%^RESET%^ This is an advanced race, known as a PK-race. It imposes disadvantages on your gameplay: You will be banned in most cities and shunned across the realm. You start with your NOPK-flag turned off and other players may attack you because of your race. You may not, however, attack a player of a standard race without additional provocation.
