%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
An enchanted race born of raw magic of the feywild, fey are a tiny race with beady eyes and strange multicolored hair, fairies appear almost exactly similar to human children or gnomes, save for their incredibly small stature and big grins. Their appearance is childishly feminine, but always with wings that can take any form ranging from butterflies to beetles. It is unknown how long faeries live, as most of them fail to see natural death, but they mature early and some individuals are known to be hundreds of years young.

Fairies live in small dense communities that resemble hives, where gatherings of them get together, and try to live in mischievous peace. Though some make home in a human city or two, this isn't done very often, and often leads to the fairies being enslaved. Bubbly and kind, fairies, however, try to get along with anyone, no matter how scary or evil they may look. While this leads to their death sometimes, this thought never really crosses their mind when talking to gargantuan dragons or when inviting orcs to games of tag.
