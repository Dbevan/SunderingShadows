%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^Personality: %^BLACK%^Nilith generally believes that the ends justify the means in all things and cares little for the sordid details. She is impulsive and jealous and openly shows her spite towards those who she deems to be troublesome. She cares little for race, creed or social status and measures people by their capability and competence. Things that she deems useless or incompetent are casually discarded and failure is often met with death. Nilith is very taken with opulence and wealth and often is depicted wearing the finest of jewelry. She is not a long-term planner and relishes in the joys of wanton and seemingly pointless destruction. She loves war and all things that fill the ground with new bodies to be risen as her servants.

%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^History: %^BLACK%^As a mortal, Nilith was a powerful tiefling general of Graez long departed from the word of history. Her army once marauded through the island, pillaging and plundering all of the wealth it could find. After many years of this, when the citizens thought it would never end, they vanished without a trace, leaving only destruction and death behind. Nilith reappeared in 742 SG as a whisper, her shining black platemail replaced by long dark robes, and her pitch-black skin adorned with gold paint. Her undead armies ravaged the land, a distraction as she murdered Varda and assumed the mantle of the god of war.

%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^Regards to Mortals: %^BLACK%^Nilith is generally quite aloof with mortals unless she needs them to perform a task for her. She is typically delighted when a mortal shows cunning or skill above and beyond the norm and will reward them with promises of power. Nilith does not speak directly with mortals, but shows them shadowy visions of whatever her thoughts are set upon. These visions are often colored and warped by her emotions and the mortal is typically expected to piece together what she wants on their own. Disappointing her means certain death. Those who serve her well and show exceptional strength will be awarded with Nilith's Graft, becoming a willful undead.

%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^Regards to Undead: %^BLACK%^This group makes heavy use of undead, as it is seen as giving adoration and praise to their lady.%^RESET%^

%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^Regards to Outsiders: %^BLACK%^This group detests devas and other good or lawful-aligned celestials. They typically do not like fey.

%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^Vestments: %^BLACK%^The clergy differ wildly in their dress from stunning opulence to simple black garments embroidered with bones as a testament to their faith. Followers generally adorn themselves in extravagent silks, gold, silver, and the finer things that they have earned (or stolen) for themselves. However, some followers choose to wear simple, plain garments. As many people see undead as abominations, some followers choose to hide their faith from the general populace.%^RESET%^

%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^Dogma: %^BLACK%^Seek immortal undeath at all costs. Mortals are born to serve the unliving gods of this realm, and the elite are destined to become them. Trample all who stand in your way. Ravage the lands and take all you desire. Avoid the path of light, for the eternal shadow of undeath is your only prize. Seek to undo the lives of others upon the battlefield, for every fallen foe is a step on the path to your eternal stride in the world of undeath.%^RESET%^

%^BOLD%^%^ORANGE%^Faith-Based Groups:%^RESET%^
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^The Risen: %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^This is a cabal of necromancers and powerful magic users seeking to rise to the ranks of intelligent undead. This sect is also rumored to be the protectors of phylacteries of powerful liches.%^RESET%^
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^The Ravenous: %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^This sect is comprised of the greedy, the war-mongers, the thieves, and the scourge of society. They seek nothing but the expansion of their power and the power of their lady.%^RESET%^
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^The Robber Knights: %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^An organization of knights under the leadership of a powerful vampire knight. Comprised of a mix of nobles and skilled warriors, they jockey for rank among themselves in combat, all of them striving to earn enough favor to join the greater undead ranks. Their charge is to hunt down traitor undead who do not bow to Nilith.%^RESET%^
