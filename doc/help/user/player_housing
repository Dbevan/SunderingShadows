Player housing is a good way for your character to leave a mark on the world. Players are encouraged to come up with good ideas and submit them, and keeping them limited in scope is the best way to get approved. Good ideas could be: A house in the woods, a garden of butterflies, or a small island with a few rooms.

RP will be prioritized for property locations. For instance, to build near the city of Shadow, the player will need to maintain proper relations with the city and be in good standing. Properties can be remodeled and added onto at a later date, do not feel the need to get a large sprawling property directly from the start. All properties need to have a physical entrance or means of entry in the sense of fairness - nowhere can be 100% isolated and inaccessible.

Properties are open to all characters when they have displayed a constant presence in the game. We understand that not everyone has the same daily availability, so we look to regular play instead. The character also has to be fully invested in the world, this means that it will be unavailable to those using the NoPK option to avoid conflict in their play. If you have several alts, we will only honor requests from your main character, as this does take a lot of time away from creators as well. As these locations will become part of Sundering Shadows, we do need to maintain certain standards. Submissions should be spell-checked and inspected for grammar before submission. Also, a level of quality with color use is expected, though we will certainly help out any players who rely on a screen reader. 

We ask that property requests be limited to one per player in a six month period.

All prices are in gold coins.

Renovations of rooms and additional features will cost half of the item's original cost. New rooms and features added will be the full cost.

Regarding old player housing:

Player houses are considered abandoned and for purchase if the player (not the character) is inactive. A player is considered inactive if they have not played in the past three years and they are unable to be contacted. A player may relinquish this protection for their properties.

Property for a character who has been officially retired and converted to an NPC becomes locked and unavailable. If that retirement is reversed for whatever reason, the property loses any such protections in the future. 

An abandoned property is valued at half the total cost of construction. Purchasing the property does not convey any further activity besides a change in ownership. In order for a player to be considered when purchasing old properties, they must have a detailed plan in place for the use of the space. In addition, if no progress is made towards that plan within two months the purchase price will be considered forfeit and ownership will be withdrawn.

Active characters that are both owned by the same player are not permitted to trade or sell properties to each other. Characters can purchase properties owned by their retired characters at the abandoned property cost.
