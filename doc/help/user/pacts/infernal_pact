Devils, the very essence of bargains and deals, are naturally sought out for dark pacts, signed in blood, to trade souls for power. The great ArchDevil, Mephasm, is said to have sealed a pact with Seija, herself, gaining his exalted position in return for the promise of facing off against the unending threat of the demons in the Abyss. Infernal Pacts typically give the power of hellfire to the practitioner in the ultimate pursuit of Law, Order, Tyranny and Suffering.
