Thieves can use nothing heavier than light armor types, as they rely on speed and stealth. Various skills and commands will either take a penalty when wearing metal armor, or will simply not work at all. A high dexterity is very important and useful to thieves.

Thieves rely on learning melee feats to expand their options in combat.
