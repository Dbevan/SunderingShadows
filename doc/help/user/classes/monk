The monk is an enlightened warrior, able to transcend many of the bodily limits that hamper most mortals. They typically belong to an order or a monastery and have an affinity for the strict procedures that this imparts on them.

They despise most traditional armor as it gets in the way of their life-long dedication to perfect their inner self. Most have an amazing ability to manipulate their own energies and that of others, which they refer to simply as "Ki", in profound ways, especially as they grow wiser.
Some monks use small weapons. Others limit themselves to using their bare hands.

Unarmed monks use the following damage table:
 Levels 1 - 9 : 1d6  damage
 Levels 10-19 : 1d8  damage
 Levels 20-29 : 1d10 damage
 Levels 30-39 : 2d6  damage
 Levels 40-49 : 2d8  damage
 Level   50   : 2d10 damage

Unarmed monks have a base critical multiplier of 2, and receive an increased critical damage multiplier of their monk level divided by 10. A level 10 monk, for example, would have a critical damage multiplier of 3.

An unarmed monk also receives +1 to damage and hit, per six levels in their monk class. This is considered magical for purposes of bypassing monster weapon resistance and or special abilities.

You may dedicate to a particular emphasis of Ki, known as ways. The current known ways are:
 %^CYAN%^The Way of The Fist
 %^CYAN%^The Way of The Shadow
 %^CYAN%^The Way of The Elements %^RESET%^

Monk feats, abilities, and spells require ki. Most monks receive 1 ki point per level starting at level 2. Ki regenerates passively. Ki regeneration rate is 1-2 every 10-20 seconds. A higher wisdom score reduces this time but never below 6 seconds.

The %^ORANGE%^<ki>%^RESET%^ command is a command showing the abilities imparted to you by your dedication, your total and available ki, and how long until you passively regenerate more.

In addition to their special abilities, monks can cast a small number of spells by expending ki points. To see which spells you can cast, see the help file for your chosen way. To cast your spells, use the %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ command. A monk will need the perfect caster feat to avoid harming their allies and summoned creatures with area-affecting spells.

The efficacy of monk abilities and spells use wisdom as their casting stat.
