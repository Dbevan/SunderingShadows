Grim and determined, the inquisitor roots out enemies of the faith, using trickery and guile when righteousness and purity is not enough. Although inquisitors are dedicated to a deity, they are above many of the normal rules and conventions of the church. They answer to their deity and their own sense of justice alone and are willing to take extreme measures to meet their goals.

Inquisitors tend to move from place to place, chasing down enemies and researching emerging threats. As a result, they often travel with others, if for no other reason than to mask their presence. Inquisitors work with members of their faith whenever possible, but even such allies are not above suspicion.

Inquisitors are spontaneous casters that use %^ORANGE%^<master>%^RESET%^ command to learn new spells from the inquisitor spell list. See %^ORANGE%^<spells inquisitor (by level)>%^RESET%^. They can %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ any mastered spell by expending a spell slot, which is prepared with the %^ORANGE%^<prepare>%^RESET%^ command. To see how many spell slots you can prepare, use %^ORANGE%^<recall inquisitor spells>%^RESET%^. They base their casting abilities on the wisdom stat.

Inquisitors also gain the following cantrips (type 'recall cantrip spells'):
Create Water, Detect Magic, Detect Poison, Guidance, Resistance, Light, Mending, Disrupt Undead, Acid Splash

They can cast in any armor they can wear, but not while wielding anything.

Inquisitors use Wisdom as opposed to Charisma for their Influence skill.

As a hybrid class with spell casting abilities, inquisitors would benefit from a combination of martial and magic feats. They will need the perfect caster feat to avoid harming their allies and summoned creatures with area-affecting spells.
