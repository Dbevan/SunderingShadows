A warlock is a being whose soul is suffused with dark and perilous magic. They do not approach magic through study or blood, as a mage or sorcerer might. Instead they enter eldritch pacts with powerful extraplanar beings who bestow the dark and arcane knowledge to weave their invocations through an act of will. While these pacts grant them access to a list of spells, their mainstays are eldritch blast, eldritch chain, and eldritch burst.

Besides spells and invocations, the warlock also is granted a selection of invocation feats, which will inherently strengthen the warlock themselves or add traits to their eldritch blast spells.

Warlocks operate on the soul burn mechanic. As they cast their eldritch blast spells, they gain soul burn, which will trade health for more power.See <help soul burn> for more information on this mechanic.

Warlocks use the %^ORANGE%^<master>%^RESET%^ command to learn their spells. Then they can just %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ any spell they know at any time they want.

Warlocks can cast in light armor, but they can't do so while wielding normal weapons. However, with pact invocation feats they can learn to cast while wielding. They will need the perfect caster feat to avoid harming their allies and summoned creatures with area-affecting spells.

The warlock is a hybrid class and mixes combat prowess with spellcasting. For the best results, a warlock should utilize both of these aspects in tandem. Charisma is the warlock's casting stat.
